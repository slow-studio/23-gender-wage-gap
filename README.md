# 23-playful-data

## why did we explore this?

data envelops us, and influences how we're controlled. however, it is opaque and un-affective. publicly, it is manifest through essays, graphs-and-charts (rectangles and circles), and dashboards. overexposure to it makes us numb to it, and at best only mildly affected. so we'd like to make it a little playful, perhaps interactive, and certainly more memorable. 

## making a mobile-specific project

we want to work on things that can be distributed en masse &mdash; instead of being niche (like augmented reality), or requiring special apps or hardware (like virtual reality), or more expensive to distribute (think: print). and so, our work is meant to work right off the bat on a mobile-browser.
